Help improve Atom by sending usage statistics, exceptions and deprecations to the team.

You will be asked at first-run whether you consent to telemetry being sent to the Atom team which includes usage statistics, sanitized exceptions and deprecation warnings. You can change your mind at a later date from the Atom Settings window.

### Collected data

* A unique UUID v4 random identifier is generated according to [RFC4122][RFC4122]
* Screen and window width and height
* Version of Atom being used including which release channel (stable, beta, dev)
* Name of each Atom view class or Atom configuration file opened in a pane, e.g. `EditorView`, `SettingsView`, `MarkdownPreviewView`, and `UserKeymap`. **No other pane item information is collected.**
* Exception messages (without paths)
* Heap memory used as MB and %
* Commands run (except core commands)
* File open events and their language grammar scope names
* Amount of time the current window was open for
* Amount of time the current window took to load
* Amount of time the app took to launch
* Deprecated package names and versions
* Chrome user-agent (version of Chrome, OS, CPU)
* The number of non-core Atom packages that have been activated
* GitHub username, if a user has authenticated with the GitHub package

This information is sent via [Google Analytics][GA] which allows the Atom team to analyze usage patterns and errors in order to help improve Atom.
